How to organize your project series:
C++ Arragement Methods

Making Libraries
  the standard is:
    > public headers go in include/projname/
    > everything else (private code) goes in src/

Applications
  options:
    > folders per class
    > folders per section
    > pure flat
    > headers for everything:
      - one main cpp file
      - single object rebuild flaw (long compile times for a single change)

Including Libraries
  > use a manager:
    - vcpkg
    - conan
  > do it manually:
    - download, build, link (or download prebuilt and link)
    - git submodules

Build Systems
  > cmake
  > premake
  >
